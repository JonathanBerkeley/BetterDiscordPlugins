Siphons text randomly from all your discord servers messages out through you into the chat you are currently looking at. 
Keybinds: Left arrow to enable. Right arrow to disable.

For use with BetterDiscord. Needs to be installed in the plugin folder which can be accessed through BetterDiscord settings -> plugin -> open plugin folder.

Plugin may be unstable, may cause crashes, may cause bans. I am in no way liable for any of that. Use at own risk.
